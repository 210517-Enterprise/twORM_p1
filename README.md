# twORM (Group Two ORM)

##Overview
TwORM is a Java based ORM tool intended to provide a simplified way of connecting to and using a PostgreSQL relational database without the need for SQL or connection management. 

##Technologies Used
*PostgreSQL 42.2.22
*Java 8.0 (1.8)
*Apache Commons 2.5.0
*JUnit Jupiter 5.7.2
*Log4j 1.2.17

##Features
*Simplified User Interface API
*Automatic Table Generation as needed
*Simple Annotation Based markup for ease of use
*Basic Transaction Control Through User API

##Coming Soon
*Foreign Key Annotation And Referential Integrity Mapping
*Mapping of Join Columns Inside Entities and Building Join Tables
*Aggregate Functions
*Complex and Conditional Querying

## Getting Started  
Currently project must be included as local dependency. to do so:
```shell
  git clone https://github.com/210517-Enterprise/twORM_p1.git
  cd twORM_p1/twORM
  mvn install
```

Next, place the following inside your project pom.xml file:
```XML
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.revature</groupId>
    <artifactId>twORM</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  </dependency>
```

Finally, inside your project structure you need a application.proprties file. 
 (typically located src/main/resources/)
 ``` 
  url=path/to/database
  admin-usr=username/of/database
  admin-pw=password/of/database  
  ```
##Usage
###Annotating Classes
All classes that are represented in the database must be annotated.
-####Entity(name = "table_name")
 -Indicates that the class is associated with the table named table_name.
-#### @Column(name = "column_name")  
 - Optional. Indicates that the Annotated field is a column in the table with the name column_name for future use with complex queries and static fields.
-#### @Setter(name = "column_name")  
 - Indicates that the anotated method is a setter for 'column_name'.  
-#### @Getter(name = "column_name")  
 - Indicates that the anotated method is a getter for 'column_name'.  
-#### @PrimaryKey(name = "column_name" isSerial=true/false) 
 - Indicates that the annotated field is the primary key for a table. The isSerial value controls whether the value is serially generated or specified by the user.

###UserAPI
-#### `public static TwORM getInstance()`
 -Returns a Singleton instance of the class that will serve as the starting point for calling all other available methods.
-#### `public HashMap<Class<?>, HashSet<Object>> getCache()`  
 -returns the cache as a HashMap.  
- #### `public boolean addClass(final Class<?> clazz)`  
 - Adds a class to the ORM. This is the method to use to declare a Class is an object inside of the database.  
- #### `public boolean UpdateObjectInDB(final Object obj)`  
 - Updates the given object in the databse.
- #### `public boolean deleteObjectFromDB(final Object obj)`  
 - Removes the given object from the database.  
- #### `public boolean addObjectToDB(final Object obj)`  
 - Adds the given object to the database. If an appropriate table does not exist, one will be generated.
- #### 'public Optional<List<Class>> getListObjectFromDB(final Class<?> clazz)`
 -Returns a list of all entries in the table that corresponds to clazz
- #### 'public Optional<Object> getByPK(Class<?> clazz, String pk)`
  -Returns the entry from the table that corresponds to clazz with the primary key PK
- #### 'public Optional<Object> getByPK(Class<?> clazz, int pk)`
  -Does the same as the prior method for an integer key (particularly useful for serial keys)
- #### 'public Optional<List<Object>> getListByColumn(Class<?> clazz, String column, Object value)`
  -Returns a list of objects selected by a value in a column. Column is the name of column and value is what will be selected against.
- #### `public Optional<List<Object>> getListByColumns(Class<?> clazz, HashMap<String, Object> columns)`
  -Returns a list of objects selected by values in multiple columns. Each entry in the hashmap is a column name and value.
- #### `public void enableAutoCommit()`
  -Enables auto commit, which is disabled by default. Use of this method is strongly discouraged.
- #### `public void disableAutoCommit()`
  -Disables auto commit. This is default setting for TwORM and only needs to be used if the prior method is invoked.
- #### `public void beginTransaction()`
  -Begins a transaction.
- #### `public void setSavePoint(String savePointName)`
  - Creates a save point in the transaction. savePointName is the name of the save point that can be referenced in other methods
- #### `public void returnToSavePoint(String savePointName)`
  - Rollsback to the save point indicated by savePointName.
- #### `public void removeSavePoint(String savePointName)`
  - Removes the save point specified by savePointName.
- #### `public void abortChanges()`
  - Rollbacks transactions.
- #### `public void commitChanges()`
  - Commits changes.
- #### `public void addAllFromDBToCache()`
  - Constructs a cache that contains all entities and entries present in the database.
